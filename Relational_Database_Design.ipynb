    "With the predicted increase in solar activity this year, NASA is building contingency plans for all of their systems. An unfortunately timed coronal mass ejection (CME) with total ejected mass equal to or greater than the Carrington Event in 1859 has potential to devastate unprotected power transmission, communications, and electronics systems globally in a way we haven't seen since the adoption of modern technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    " NASA has put out a contract to design a replacement database that stores all their previous and upcoming mission information. This database would include information on Astronauts, Missions, Training, Launch Vehicles, Spacecraft, and daily information about the International Space Station (ISS)."
